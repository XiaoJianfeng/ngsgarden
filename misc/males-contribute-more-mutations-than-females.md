## 男性比女性给后代带来了更多的突变(Males Contribute More Mutations Than Females)

A good explanation from http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/M/Mutations.html#Males_Contribute_More_Mutations_Than_Females.

```
If most mutations occur during S phase of cell division, then males should be more at risk. This is because

* only two dozen (24) or so mitotic divisions occur from the fertilized egg that starts a little girl's embryonic development and the setting aside of her future eggs (which is done long before she is even born).
* The sperm of a 30-year old man, in contrast, are the descendants of at least 400 mitotic divisions since the fertilized egg that formed him.

So,

* fathers are more likely than mothers to transmit newly-formed mutations to their children.
    - The sperm of a 25-year-old man might carry some 45 new mutations. This number rises at a rate of about 1 per year, so the sperm of a 40-year-old man may transmit some 60 new mutations to his children (about 20 of these in coding regions).
    - No matter what the age of the mother, she transmits only about 15 new mutations to her offspring. (But chromosomal aberrations, like aneuploidy, are more apt to arise in eggs than in sperm, and the incidence of these increases with maternal age.)
* These data explain why the children of aged fathers suffer more genetic disorders than those of young fathers.

翻译如下：
```
假如大部分的突变都发生在细胞分裂的S期，那么男性产生突变的概率更高，因为：

* 女性从受精卵的胚胎发育开始，到卵子的形成（在女性出生之前很久就已经形成），只经历了大概24次有丝分裂。

* 与此相对，一个30岁男性的精子，是发育成该男性的受精卵经过至少400次有丝分裂的后代。

所以，

* 父亲比母亲更容易遗传新发的突变给子女。

    - 一个25岁男子的精子可能携带大概45个新发突变，这个数字大概每年增加1，一个40岁男子的精子可能遗传60个新发突变给其子女（这其中有大约20突变位于编码区）。

    - 不论母亲的年龄大小，其遗传给后代的突变数目大概是15个。但是染色体异常--比如多倍体--在卵子中产生的概率比在镜子中更高，并且此概率随着母亲年龄增加而增加。

* 这些数据解释了为什么年老父亲的孩子患遗传病的概率比年轻父亲的孩子要高。
